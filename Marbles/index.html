									<h2><b><u>Concepts Developed:</b></u></h2>
								</header>
								
								<h4> <u> Overview: </u> </h4>
								<p>
									The Curioso Marbles project was my first professionally developed title that has been published. Because of this I focused on developing everything within it as professionally as possible, as this was also my first experience of working in a games studio. </br>
									For this project I developed the AI opponent and the ranking system as well as implemented the music and sfx. Along with doing QA towards the end of the project.
								</p>
								
								<h4> <u> Opponent AI: </u> </h4>
								<p>
									There needed to be an AI opponent developed for the Vs mode, so I was tasked with developing a realistic 'human' opponent player. To go about this task I had a few initial questions to answer. These being, how does the AI scale with the player's skill level, how should the AI decide what move it should do and how should the AI react to the constantly changing enviroment. 
									Solving these questions took a fair bit of experimentation and reworking. </br> 
									This is how the final AI works: </br>
								</p>
				
								<p>
									The AI is given a random skill level that is within a boundary of the players'. This skill level is determined internally as a value between 0 and the skill level count, which will make the decision making manipulation easier to handle later on. 
									This value is used to make the AI play at the player's skill level through using having a chance to perform a random move instead of the best calculated move. When the AI is making a decision as to a move a random number is chosen, if that number is greater than the current skill level, scaled up to a 1->100 scale, then a random move is chosen. This results in the higher level opponents making random moves less than in lower level matches.
									If this random occurance doesn't happen then the best possible move is calculated, based off the current board, and is carried out. </br> </br>

									In order to calculate the best possible move, the AI goes through a process in which a loop sweeps across the boards' columns to check the amount of connecting marbles of the same colour to the top most marbles in that column. Once the sweep has finished then the best position for the AI's current marbles colour is calculated, taking into consideration the secondary marble's colour. If no good positions are possible for the primary colour then the check switches to checking for the secondary colour.
									If both colours are found to have good positions next to each other then this is ranked higher than just a singular colour match. As a result the AI will position the marbles into the correct orientation for this double match to happen. If neither colour has a good posiion then a random empty column is selected, prioritising columns that don't have other marbles near them, and the marbles are stacked in that column. </br> </br>

									Once the best position has been calculated for the current marbles, then the best positional move is calculated. This is only done when the marble is not currently moving, to reduce the unnessary calls to this calculation. If the random check from before passes then the move calculated is performed. If the marbles are already in the correct column and orientation then a 'swipe down' move is performed, making the marbles fast fall into position.
								</p>
								
								<h4> <u> SFX Implementing </u> </h4>
								<p>
									The audio and sfx within this project was done similar to how rituals implements the audio, with a central object controlling all of the audio files and triggering sounds. This allows for complete control over the volume of all audio within the game at once.
								</p>
								
								<h4> <u> Score Counter And Ranking Changes </u> </h4>
								<p>
									
								</p>
								
								<h4> <u> Quality Assurance </u> </h4>
								<p>
									Towards the end of the project all that was left to do was carry out QA and fix any bugs that arose from this testing. Overall, now many new bugs were discovered during this time, but the ones that were found were focused on until they were fixed.
